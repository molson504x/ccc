        <p>The purpose of Comfort Canines for Christ (CCC) is to glorify God by fulfilling His directive to lend comfort.  CCC lends comfort to people in stressful situations or environments by utilizing specially trained comfort dogs.  Disaster relief efforts, hospice, nursing homes, and hospitals are CCC's primary areas for ministry.</p>
        <p>Establishment of CCC was prompted by the Board of Directors' prior participation with a charity that raises service dogs and provides those animals free of charge to disabled or special needs people throughout the United States.  As puppy raisers for this organization, the founding officers of Comfort Canines for Christ received training and instruction by certified dog trainers in canine handling techniques.  The officers of Comfort Canines for Christ have directly participated in raising five dogs for use as service animals.</p>
        <p>In January 2015 after an extensive search for a suitable dog CCC acquired Eve, a female Yellow Lab and Golden Retriever mix.  Her training, including numerous public outings, has proved successful, and she began comfort dog service in May 2015.  Our hope is to add additional dogs and handlers to the ministry.  If you are interested in participating in CCC's ministry or know of a circumstance in which CCC can provide comfort, please do not hesitate to contact us.  If you would like to follow CCC's journey, join us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/317722785018444/">Facebook (Comfort Canines for Christ)</a>.</p>
          <p>The prayer of CCC's board is that God will grant wisdom to each CCC participant and award His full favor to this ministry.  We ask for your prayers that we may share our Lord's compassion and saving grace through this ministry.  As a new charitable ministry, CCC is currently funded solely by the founders.  CCC bylaws specify that no board memners or volunteers will receive any compensation or financialy benefit from their work with CCC.  All donations will be handled with biblical principles of stewardship.</p>
