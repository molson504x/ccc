			<p><strong>We're all misfits.</strong></p>
			<p>And so are you.  The bible tells us so (Romans 3:23 says "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.")  We live in a fallen world sick with sin.  In fact, even those who have accepted Christ as their Savior will continue to struggle with sin until Jesus returns to establish His kingdom on earth.  The most noble men of the bible - such as Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, David, Moses, Samson, Jonah, Peter, and Paul - all failed God miserably.  But, God still used them for such great things that even today these sinners continue to influence lives by how God used them for His glory.</p>
			<p>Two modern day phrases describing Christina service include:
				<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li>"God does not call the qualified.  He qualifies the call"</li>
					<li>"It's not your abilities that count, it's your availability!"</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Comfort Canines for Christ is <strong>NOT</strong> seeking people with a preselected set of skills who will perfectly fit into a predetermined mold.  Romans 12:6 says "Having gifts that <strong>differ</strong> according to the grace given to us, let us use them."  The bible lists about twenty (20) spiritual gifts that God has bestowed upon those having accepted Christ as their Savior, and CCC welcomes those who God is sending to exercise their particular spiritual gift(s).  Volunteers hav varying degrees of availability, expertise, and interests.  <u>The intent of CCC's application process is not to disqualify people but to aid in determining where and how volunteers' abilities and time can best be applied.</u></p>
			<p>Volunteers must be age 18 or above; however, children of volunteers are welcome to participate with CCC under the supervision or permission of their parent(s) or guardian(s).  CCC is a strong advocate of youth participation within our ministry, and allowable activities by youth will be determined on a case by case basis.</p>
			<p>CCC's ministry entails working with society's most vulnerable people including children, the elderly, special needs people, hospitalized patients, those confined to nursing homes or hospice care, and individuals coping with personal tragedies or natural disasters.  <mark>Thus, CCC conducts background checks to appropriately screen applicants wishing to represent our organization.</mark>  Background checks include criminal history and sex offender registries.  In addition, a credit report review may be requested for those participating in fiduciary duties on CCC's behalf.  The identities of reporting agencies will be disclosed to CCC applicants, and all information recieved from reporting agencies will be available for inspection by the applicant if requested.  <strong><mark>Conviction(s) for a criminal ofense may not necessarily preclude an individual from serving God through CCC.  The nature of the offense(s), the time elapsed since the occurance of the offense(s), the relevance of the offense(s) to CCC's mission, as well as other factors of relevance will be taken into consideration.</mark></strong></p>
